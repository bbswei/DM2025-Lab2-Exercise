This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",

        "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
        "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
        "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
        "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
        "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",

            "At its core, **Data Mining** is the process of discovering hidden patterns, valuable insights, and useful knowledge from large sets of data.\n",
            "\n",
            "Think of it like being a detective. You have a massive amount of raw information (the \"data\"), and your job is to sift through it to find clues (the \"patterns\") that tell a story or help you predict what might happen next. It's not about simply looking up a specific piece of information; it's about uncovering relationships and trends that weren't obvious before.\n",
            "\n",
            "Data Mining is an interdisciplinary field, borrowing techniques from:\n",
            "*   **Statistics:** To quantify relationships and test for significance.\n",

            "\n",
            "The primary goals of data mining are typically:\n",
            "1.  **Description:** Finding human-interpretable patterns that describe the data. For example, discovering that customers who buy product A also tend to buy product B.\n",
            "2.  **Prediction:** Using variables in the dataset to predict unknown or future values of other variables. For example, predicting which customers are likely to stop using a service.\n",
            "\n",
            "Common techniques include **classification** (sorting data into categories), **clustering** (grouping similar data points together), **regression** (predicting a continuous number), and **association rule mining** (finding relationships between items).\n",

            "*   **The Data:** Researchers collect massive, anonymized datasets from platforms like Twitter, Reddit (especially support subreddits), or personal blogs. This data includes the text of posts, timestamps, frequency of posting, and social interaction patterns (likes, replies).\n",
            "*   **The Data Mining Technique:** This is primarily a **Classification** task, often combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",
            "    1.  **Training:** A machine learning model is \"trained\" on a dataset where some individuals are known to have a diagnosis of depression (e.g., they self-declared it in a post). The model learns to associate certain linguistic features with the \"depressed\" category.\n",
            "    2.  **Pattern Discovery:** The model might discover patterns such as:\n",
            "        *   Increased use of first-person singular pronouns (\"I,\" \"me,\" \"my\").\n",
            "        *   More frequent use of words associated with negative emotions (e.g., \"sad,\" \"alone,\" \"hopeless\").\n",
            "        *   A shift in posting times to late at night or early in the morning, suggesting sleep disturbances.\n",
            "        *   A decrease in social engagement or a change in the complexity of language.\n",
            "    3.  **Prediction:** Once trained, the model can be applied to new, unseen text data to classify an individual's risk level (e.g., \"low risk,\" \"moderate risk,\" \"high risk\").\n",
            "*   **Real-World Impact:** This research can power mental health chatbots, provide insights for public health officials tracking population-level mental wellness, and potentially create tools that flag at-risk individuals for human counselors or moderators on online platforms.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Example 2: Identifying Subtypes of Autism or Depression\n",

            "*   **The Goal:** A diagnosis like \"Major Depressive Disorder\" or \"Autism Spectrum Disorder\" is a broad label for a very diverse group of people. The goal is to discover if there are distinct, meaningful subgroups within these diagnoses, which could lead to more personalized and effective treatments.\n",
            "*   **The Data:** Researchers gather large, complex datasets from hundreds or thousands of patients. This data can include:\n",
            "    *   Symptom checklists and behavioral assessments.\n",
            "    *   Genetic information.\n",

            "*   **The Data Mining Technique:** This is a classic **Clustering** problem.\n",
            "    1.  **Grouping:** A clustering algorithm is applied to the dataset without any preconceived notions of what the groups should be. The algorithm's job is to find patients who are most similar to each other across all the different data points and group them together.\n",
            "    2.  **Pattern Discovery:** The analysis might reveal, for example, three distinct subtypes of depression:\n",
            "        *   **Cluster 1:** Characterized primarily by anxiety and insomnia, with specific brain activity patterns, and responds best to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n",
            "        *   **Cluster 2:** Characterized by fatigue and anhedonia (loss of pleasure), linked to a different genetic marker, and responds better to a specific class of antidepressant medication.\n",
            "        *   **Cluster 3:** A milder form characterized by seasonal mood changes and atypical symptoms.\n",
            "*   **Real-World Impact:** This moves psychology toward \"precision medicine.\" Instead of a trial-and-error approach to treatment, a clinician could identify a patient's specific subtype and immediately recommend the therapy or medication with the highest probability of success, saving time, money, and reducing patient suffering.\n",

        "\n",
        "The gemini-2.5-pro model produced a longer and more detailed response than gemini-2.5-flash-lite.\n",
        "While the flash-lite version gave a clear, structured answer with two psychological applications, the pro model provided deeper technical explanations, more academic tone, and richer context (e.g., links to statistics, machine learning, and database systems).\n",
        "The pro model also offered step-by-step reasoning and additional examples, but required more time to generate.\n",
        "Overall, flash-lite is faster and concise—suitable for quick summaries—whereas pro delivers higher-quality, in-depth, and pedagogical content.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What would happen if I change the system prompt?\n",
        "\n",
        "If the system prompt were modified, the model’s tone, structure, and focus would change significantly.\n",
        "For example, setting the system prompt to “You are a university professor explaining data mining to first-year psychology students” would make the output more educational, using simpler language, clearer section headings, and examples tailored to a student audience.\n",
        "Conversely, a system prompt like “You are a data scientist writing a technical report” would make the response more formal and technical, emphasizing algorithms, statistical methods, and data workflows.\n",
        "This demonstrates that the system prompt acts as a contextual guide—it shapes how the model interprets the user’s query, adjusts its level of detail, and adapts its communication style to match the intended audience or purpose"

        "**`langextract`** is an open-source Python library from Google designed to create trustworthy data extraction pipelines. It uses LLMs to convert unstructured text into structured data with a focus on reliability and traceability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Precise Grounding:** Its core feature. It maps every extracted item to its exact character position in the original text, allowing for easy verification.\n",
        "*   **Reliable Structured Output:** Uses examples (few-shot prompting) to ensure the LLM's output consistently follows a predefined format.\n",
        "*   **Adaptable & No Fine-Tuning:** Can be adapted to any domain (e.g., legal, medical) simply by changing the examples and instructions, without needing to retrain a model.\n",
        "*   **Handles Long Documents:** Built to process lengthy texts that might exceed an LLM's standard context window.\n",
        "*   **Flexible LLM Support:** It is model-agnostic and works with various LLMs like Gemini, OpenAI models, and even local open-source models through Ollama.\n",

              " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

        "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
